// JavaScript is single-threaded, but it supports asynchronous, non-blocking execution using the 
// event loop, call stack, Web APIs, and task queues. Instead of waiting for slow tasks like API calls
//  or timers, JS delegates them to the environment, continues with other code, and
//  executes the async callback later when the call stack is free.
